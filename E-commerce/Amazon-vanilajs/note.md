- **flex:1;** to take up the remaining space. look at .nav-search
- **margin: auto;** to **justify-center, align-items:center;** at the same time.
- of input field: border,outline: none; to take up the parent div properties. #nav-search-input
- **font-weight** is equivalent to font-bold

- **text-decoration:none;** to remove default styling of a tag. i.e. to remove the underline of an ```a``` tag.
